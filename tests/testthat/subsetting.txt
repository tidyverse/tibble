[.tbl_df is careful about column flags (#83)
============================================

> foo[c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)]
Error: Must subset columns with a valid subscript vector.
i Logical subscripts must match the size of the indexed input.
x The input has size 3 but the subscript `foo` has size 4.

> foo[c(TRUE, TRUE, NA)]
Error: Can't use NA as column index with `[` at position 3.

> foo[as.matrix(TRUE)]
Error: Invalid `j`: if a matrix, it must have the same dimensions as `x`.

> foo[array(TRUE, dim = c(1, 1, 1))]
Error: `i` must have one dimension, not 3.


[.tbl_df rejects unknown column indexes (#83)
=============================================

> foo <- tibble(x = 1:10, y = 1:10, z = 1:10)
> foo[list(1:3)]
Error: Must subset columns with a valid subscript vector.
x The subscript `foo` has the wrong type `list`.
i It must be logical, numeric, or character.

> foo[as.list(1:3)]
Error: Must subset columns with a valid subscript vector.
x The subscript `foo` has the wrong type `list`.
i It must be logical, numeric, or character.

> foo[factor(1:3)]
Error: Can't subset columns that don't exist.
x The columns `1`, `2`, and `3` don't exist.

> foo[Sys.Date()]
Error: Must subset columns with a valid subscript vector.
x The subscript `foo` has the wrong type `date`.
i It must be logical, numeric, or character.

> foo[Sys.time()]
Error: Must subset columns with a valid subscript vector.
x The subscript `foo` has the wrong type `datetime<local>`.
i It must be logical, numeric, or character.


[[.tbl_df throws error with NA index
====================================

> foo <- tibble(x = 1:10, y = 1:10)
> foo[[NA]]
Error: Must extract column with a single valid subscript.
x The subscript `NA` can't be `NA`.

> foo[[NA_integer_]]
Error: Must extract column with a single valid subscript.
x The subscript `NA_integer_` can't be `NA`.

> foo[[NA_real_]]
Error: Must extract column with a single valid subscript.
x The subscript `NA_real_` can't be `NA`.

> foo[[NA_character_]]
Error: Must extract column with a single valid subscript.
x The subscript `NA_character_` can't be `NA`.


[<-.tbl_df throws an error with duplicate indexes (#658)
========================================================

> df <- tibble(x = 1:2, y = x)
> df[c(1, 1)] <- 3
Error: Column index 1 is used more than once for assignment.

> df[, c(1, 1)] <- 3
Error: Column index 1 is used more than once for assignment.

> df[c(1, 1), ] <- 3
Error: Row index 1 is used more than once for assignment.


[<-.tbl_df throws an error with invalid values
==============================================

> df <- tibble(x = 1:2, y = x)
> df[1] <- lm(y ~ x, df)
Error: `value` must be a vector, a bare list, a data frame or NULL in `[<-`.

> df[1:2, 1] <- NULL
Error: `value` must be a vector, a bare list or a data frame in `[<-`.


$<- recycles only values of length one
======================================

> df <- tibble(x = 1:3)
> df$w <- 8:9
Error: Tibble columns must have consistent sizes, only values of size one are recycled:
* Size 3: Existing data
* Size 2: Column `w`

> df$a <- character()
