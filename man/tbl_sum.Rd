}
\description{
\code{tbl_sum()} gives a brief textual description of a table-like object,
which should include the dimensions and the data source in the first element,
and additional information in the other elements (such as grouping for \pkg{dplyr}).
The default implementation forwards to \code{\link[pillar:type_sum]{pillar::obj_sum()}}.
}
\details{
This generic will be moved to \pkg{pillar}, and reexported from there
as soon as it becomes available.
